# WebRTC
Learn WebRTC from basics to advanced with real-world projects like video calling, screen sharing, and real-time chat.

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an API that can be used by video-chat, voice-calling, and P2P-file-sharing Web apps.

WebRTC consists mainly of these parts:

getUserMedia()
Grants access to a device's camera and/or microphone, and can plug in their signals to a RTC connection.

RTCPeerConnection
An interface to configure video chat or voice calls.

RTCDataChannel
Provides a method to set up a peer-to-peer data pathway between browsers.
